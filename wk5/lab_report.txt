This lab(week5) demonstrates TCP and UDP packet transmission using Packet Sender.
Wireshark was used to capture and analyze TCP and UDP traffic.
TCP packets were analyzed using filters such as tcp.port == 80 and tcp.flags.reset == 1.
UDP packets were analyzed using the udp filter.
A DigitalOcean Ubuntu droplet was used as the server.
UFW firewall was configured to allow OpenSSH and then enabled.
